/////elevator pitch///
"Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map."

///scenes

Death:
	This is when the player dies and should be somthing funny
	
Central Corridor
	This is the starting point and has aGothon already standing there they have to defeat with a  joke
	 before continuing 
	
Laser Weapon Armory
	This is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to blow up the ship before getting to the escape pod. It 	has a keypad the hero has to guess the number for.

The Bridge
	Another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places the bomb.

Escape Pod 
	Where the hero escapes but only after guessing the right escape pod.
