As a Ronso Kimahri has blue fur and white hair and beard. Like all Ronso, he is leonine, tall and muscular, has a 
tail and a horn on his forehead. Kimahri's horn is broken, causing him great shame as a Ronso. His ears are 
pierced, and his hair is held back in a ponytail and braided on the sides. Due to his fur Kimahri doesn't need to 
wear clothes for warmth. He wears leather straps that hold in place his arm guards and his chest piece that has a 
skull motif. He wears ankle guards and a sash tied around his waist with a red belt. His shoulder guards have 
tufts of white feathers or fur.
